# rotating-house-threejs
Simple Three.js + WebGL 3D website. 

I got inspired by Bruno Simon's portfolio website (https://bruno-simon.com/) which is created with Three.js.
After visiting his site and being mindblown, I immediately started experimenting with Three.js.

I used this 3D model from Sketchfab: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/house-6eb02721fa574c249184779c1242ae07
